   THIS IS THE FILE TO EDIT.

   Everything the homepage shows comes from here. Changing the site
   means changing this file — nothing else needs touching.

   To add a project: copy one block inside `projects` and fill it in.
   To reorder the rack: move blocks up or down.
   To remove one: delete its block.
